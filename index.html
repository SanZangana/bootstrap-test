                <h3>Strength</h3>
                <p>Remember when you watched all the cartoon movies or read those comic books? 
                    Why did you like the main character or superhero so much?
                    Today we don't see that sort of Strength being showcased in media or even in real life.
                    I mean, when was the last time YOU stod up to something or someone?

                <h3>Honor</h3>
                <p>Honor is the act of standing ten toes down on things that you believe in.
                    Don't do it for validation, do it for yourself or your family.

                <h3>Mastery</h3>
                <p>Having a arsenal of knowledge or attributes is a very crucial part of being a man in todays society.
                    It has always been admirable when a man knows how to operate in life with several skills.
                    These things can be anything, how to program, building something physical, surviving in the wilderness etc.

                <p>Doing things regardless of reaction. 
                    When we do things and people or even the whole world judges us, 
                    will we back down or keep our head up?</p>
